# Multi-object-Tracking-for-mobile-robotics-using-DeepSORT
The task of this project is to detect and track Multi-Objects using DeepSort Algorithm for robotic perception. Throughout this Project We have customly trained the DeepSort Algorithm to detect and track the dynamic obstacles like Pedestrians, Cyclist, Cars, etc. We are planing to deploy this model to our <a href="https://github.com/BharatDadwaria/Self-Driving-toy-car-A-low-scale-implementatino-of-Autonomous-Robot-">Mobile robot</a> embedded with NVIDIA Jetson Nano with Raspberry Pi Camera module.
